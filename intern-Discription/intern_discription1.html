                <p>
                    At Amazon, we hire the best minds in technology to innovate and build on behalf of our customers.
                    The intense focus we have on our customers is why we are one of the world's most beloved brands -
                    customer obsession is part of our company DNA. Our interns write real software and collaborate with
                    a select group of experienced software development engineers (SDEs) who guide interns on projects
                    that matter to our customers.
                    As an intern, you will be matched to a manager and a mentor. You will have the opportunity to
                    influence the evolution of Amazon technology and lead mission critical projects early in your
                    career. Your design, code, and raw smarts will contribute to solving some of the most complex
                    technical challenges in the areas of distributed systems, data mining, automation, optimization,
                    scalability, and security - just to name a few. In addition to working on an impactful project, you
                    will have the opportunity to engage with Amazonians for both personal and professional development,
                    expand your network, and participate in activities with other interns throughout your internship. No
                    matter the location of your internship, we give you the tools to own your project and learn in a
                    real-world setting. Many of our technologies overlap, and you would be hard pressed to find a team
                    that is not using Amazon Web Services (AWS), touching the catalogue, or iterating services to better
                    personalize for customers.
                    If this opportunity interests you, apply and come chart your own path at Amazon. By applying to this
                    position your application will be considered for all locations we hire for in India. This includes
                    but is not limited to Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi and Pune.
                    Amazon internships are full-time (40 hours/week) for eight consecutive weeks (two months) with start
                    dates between April and May 2022 or six months (as per university academic framework) with start
                    dates between January and February 2022.
